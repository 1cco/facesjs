do any need type-specific metadata? like "this type of eye needs some other paramter to render"?
- pinnochio shouldn't be centered, it should have its right/left edge centered (depending on flip)

DRY for draw* functions

add size option to other features, like nose

make backwards compatible
- version param in face
- if necessary, depend on v1 for this

get smarter about processing SVGs, like what if doctype of svg tag is spread over multiple lines?

build gui editor, add to README
- yarn start
- hot reloading (or params in query string)

documentation in readme about how to add/change facial features
- size matters
- for head/hair, positioning matters?

es5 and es6 builds
- es6 needs no build, just src directly?
- es5 rollup switch from iife to cjs, no name needed
  - or just babel, no rollup

round decimals

blog
- backwards compatible, if interesting
- reddit

generate a couple options for each feature
randomize all sizes/angles/positions of features as appropriate
How do I generalize fatness and skin color and whatever in general while allowing for bbgm-specific values to be set?
how to link skin color and hair color?

FOR FIRST TRY:
- head
  - have them all with the same top half (different bottom halfs, though, and then randomize the width and height of the head to create fat/skinny faces. the current one is the fattest possible
- eye (duplicate on face)
  - angle
  - flip for left/right
- eyebrow (duplicate on face)
  - angle
  - flip for left/right
- nose
- mouth
THEN:
- headbands
- glasses
- facial lines
- facial hair
