how big should the canvas be, and how much white space should there be?
generate a couple options for each feature
How do I generalize fatness and skin color and whatever in general while allowing for bbgm-specific values to be set?

FOR FIRST TRY:
- head
  - have them all with the same top half (different bottom halfs, though, and then randomize the width and height of the head to create fat/skinny faces. the current one is the fattest possible
- eye (duplicate on face)
  - angle
  - flip for left/right
- eyebrow (duplicate on face)
  - angle
  - flip for left/right
- nose
- mouth
THEN:
- headbands
- glasses
- facial lines
- facial hair
