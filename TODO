version 2 - all SVGs in external files, load from there and assemble for each face

fatness

would need to still have some metadata defined, for example for how eyes have different offsets?
- maybe somehow finding bounding box and centering that would be good enough
 - demonstrate ability to load face, shrink based on fatness, and place eyes (with variable distance and rotation)
- or could give the svgs normal names, and specify optional metadata in JS
  - each folder could have a default (like placement of 2 eyes in specific locations), but could also override individuals (like if there was an "accessories" folder)

make backwards compatible
- version param in face

es5 and es6 builds
- es6 needs no build, just src directly?
- es5 rollup switch from iife to cjs, no name needed

prettier

round decimals

generate a couple options for each feature
randomize all sizes/angles/positions of features as appropriate
How do I generalize fatness and skin color and whatever in general while allowing for bbgm-specific values to be set?
how to link skin color and hair color?

FOR FIRST TRY:
- head
  - have them all with the same top half (different bottom halfs, though, and then randomize the width and height of the head to create fat/skinny faces. the current one is the fattest possible
- eye (duplicate on face)
  - angle
  - flip for left/right
- eyebrow (duplicate on face)
  - angle
  - flip for left/right
- nose
- mouth
THEN:
- headbands
- glasses
- facial lines
- facial hair
