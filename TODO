es5 (main, cjs) and es6 (module, esm) builds
- es6 needs no build, just src directly?
  - no, still babel, just with no module->require
- es5 rollup switch from iife to cjs, no name needed
  - or just babel, no rollup
  - babel is needed, though

- no watch needed, that can be just for gui

get smarter about processing SVGs, like what if doctype of svg tag is spread over multiple lines?
- https://github.com/Leonidas-from-XIV/node-xml2js but claims builder is not very good in issues
- https://github.com/buglabs/node-xml2json looks nice, but windows support
- https://github.com/nashwaan/xml-js maybe preferrable to above
- could write my own. "just" needs to identify and remove the doctype and <svg> open/close tags, the rest doesn't even need to be parsed
  - but full parse can bring compression
- what does https://github.com/svg/svgo do?
  - node-sax for parsing (i could simply require and use their svg2js function)
  - js2svg is custom - could also use!
  - could use whole module directly https://github.com/svg/svgo/blob/master/examples/test.js

try making a new svg in inkscape, does it actually work?

make backwards compatible
- version param in face
- if necessary, depend on v1 for this

documentation in readme about how to add/change facial features
- size matters
- for head/hair, positioning matters
- pinnochio special case, can do others or generalize if necessary
- viewer

update index.html, integrate viewer

blog
- backwards compatible, if interesting
- reddit

---

add size option to other features, like nose

---

generate a couple options for each feature
randomize all sizes/angles/positions of features as appropriate
How do I generalize fatness and skin color and whatever in general while allowing for bbgm-specific values to be set?
how to link skin color and hair color?

- headbands
- glasses
- facial lines
- facial hair
